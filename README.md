# **Financial Analytics**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes the **market capitalization and quarterly sales** of India's **top 500 companies** to uncover key financial trends and insights. Using **Python**, we explore relationships between sales and valuation, identify market leaders, and provide data-driven strategies for better financial decision-making.  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset contains:  
- **Company Name**: Name of the company  
- **Market Capitalization (`Mar Cap - Crore`)**: Market cap value in crores  
- **Quarterly Sales (`Sales Qtr - Crore`)**: Sales revenue for the latest quarter in crores  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (for data analysis and visualization)  
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (for data visualization)  
- **Google Colab** (for execution and cloud storage integration)

## **Project Workflow**  

### **1. Data Loading**  
- Imported dataset from Google Drive  
- Displayed **summary statistics** and dataset structure  

### **2. Data Cleaning**  
- Removed **irrelevant columns**  
- Handled **missing values** by dropping incomplete records  
- Eliminated **duplicate entries**  

### **3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Histogram for Market Capitalization** â†’ Most companies have **lower market caps**, with a few large firms dominating  
- **Histogram for Quarterly Sales** â†’ Sales distribution is **skewed**, indicating market concentration among a few top players  
- **Scatter Plot (Market Cap vs. Sales)** â†’ Showcased a **positive correlation** between sales and market valuation  

### **4. Statistical Analysis**  
- **Correlation Matrix** â†’ Strong **positive correlation** between Market Capitalization & Sales  
- **Key Financial Metrics** â†’ Computed **mean, median, and standard deviation** for valuation insights  

### **5. Top Companies Analysis**  
- Extracted **Top 10 Companies** based on Market Capitalization

## **Key Findings**  
ðŸ“Œ **Market Concentration:** A few firms dominate both **valuation and sales**, while smaller companies struggle to compete.  
ðŸ“Œ **Positive Correlation:** Higher **quarterly sales** generally lead to **higher market capitalization**, but exceptions exist.
